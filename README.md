# Compilers-standford
This repository contains solutions to course assignments as well as important concepts taught in the course "Compilers" by Alex Aiken, available on [StandfordOnline](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycs cs1-compilers)

## Description

This self-paced course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including **lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems**. As a result, you will learn 8how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.
